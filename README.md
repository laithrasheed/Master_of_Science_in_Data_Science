# Data Mining Foundations and Practice

**In this specialization I learnt the fundamental concepts and core techniques for discovering patterns in large-scale data sets.**

**The specialization consists of three courses:**

### [(1) Data Mining Pipeline](https://github.com/laithrasheed/MSDS_Program_Private/tree/main/Computer%20Science%20Core%20Courses/Data%20Mining%20Foundations%20and%20Practice/Data%20Mining%20Pipeline)

- The first course introduces the key steps of data understanding, data preprocessing, data warehouse, data modeling and interpretation/evaluation.
- Quizes, Programming, and Peer Reviewed Assignments were being the assessment criteria in addition to a multiple choice final exam. 


### [(2) Data Mining Methods](https://github.com/laithrasheed/MSDS_Program_Private/tree/main/Computer%20Science%20Core%20Courses/Data%20Mining%20Foundations%20and%20Practice/Data%20Mining%20Methods)

- The second course covers core techniques for frequent pattern analysis, classification, clustering, and outlier detection
- Quizes, Programming, and Peer Reviewed Assignments were being the assessment criteria in addition to a multiple choice final exam.  

### [(3) Data Mining Project](https://github.com/laithrasheed/MSDS_Program_Private/tree/main/Computer%20Science%20Core%20Courses/Data%20Mining%20Foundations%20and%20Practice/Data%20Mining%20Project)

- The third course offers guidance and hands-on experience of designing and implementing a real-world data mining project.
-  I have completed a peer reviewed project worth 10% of my grade.
- The project is about conducting a comparison between **GRU and CNN Algorithms** in the **Transportation Engineering Field**.
- In the below table you can find the Jupyter Notebook, Project Report, and Project Slides.
