# Master of Science in Data Science (MSDS)


Welcome to the MSDS repository, where I present the curriculum of the program alongside projects I have implemented during my journey of pursuing the Master's Degree from the University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder). The MSDS is an interdisciplinary degree that brings together faculty from CU Boulder’s departments of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, Information Science, and others. The MSDS Program is a Non-Thesis Degree that consists of 30 credit hours, such that each credit hour represent one course that belongs to a specific specialziation.

the below table shows you the MSDS curriculm and helps navigate directly to a course or a specialziation you are interesetd to view that is listed in this README file

- I have completed a peer reviewed final project worth 45% of my grade.
- The final project is about applying Deep Learning approaches for a project of my choice. I have selected the [Vehicle Type Recognition Dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python?datasetId=42674](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggleashwin/vehicle-type-recognition))  that is hosted on Kaggle, where the goal is to train a model that classify the vehicles to the correct classification.
-  In the below table you can find the Jupyter Notebook for the Vehicle Type Recognition problem.
