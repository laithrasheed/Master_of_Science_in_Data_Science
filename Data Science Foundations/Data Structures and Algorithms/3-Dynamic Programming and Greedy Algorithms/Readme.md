# Dynamic Programming and Greedy Algorithms [<sup>[1]</sup>](#reference-1)				

## Brief Description
- This course covers basic algorithm design techniques such as divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms. It concludes with a brief introduction to intractability (NP-completeness) and using linear/integer programming solvers for solving optimization problems.
