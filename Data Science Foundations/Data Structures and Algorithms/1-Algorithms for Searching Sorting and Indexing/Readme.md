## Course Content

### Week 1 | Basics of Algorithms Through Searching and Sorting

#### Learning Objectives
- Analyze computational complexity of algorithms.
- Prove correctness of algorithms using inductive invariants.
- Analyze the running time of binary search, insertion sort, bubble sort and merge sort algorithms.
- Prove correctness of binary search, insertion sort, bubble sort and merge sort algorithms.
- Compare running time of algorithms through big-O, big-Omega and big-Theta notations

#### Programming Assignment
- **Introductions to Algorithms**

### Week 2 | Heaps and Hashtable Data Structures

#### Learning Objectives
- Understand the need for data structures and how these are used in programming.
- Define the properties of a min/max heap and reason about the implication of these properties.
- Analyze the correctness and running time of insertion, deletion and find minimum/maximum operations on a heap.
- Identify problems that can be solved efficiently using heaps and problems where heaps may be a sub-optimal choice.
- Understand hashtable data structure, its organization and properties.
- Learn the basic differences between a heap and a hashtable data-structure. Understand when to use a hashtable as opposed to a heap data-structure

#### Programming Assignment
- **Heap Data Structures**

### Week 3 | Randomization: Quicksort, Quickselect, and Hashtables

#### Learning Objectives
- Understand and implement quicksort algorithm with a carefully designed partition scheme.
- Prove correctness of the partition scheme and the algorithm.
- Understand and implement the quickselect algorithm.
- Perform an empirical evaluation of running time for quicksort and quickselect algorithms
- Understand the pitfalls behind hash function design for hashtables and the use of randomization to make hashtables work against the worst case.

#### Programming Assignment
- **Quicksort and Hash Functions**

### Week 4 | Advanced Topics

#### Learning Objectives
- Design open-address hash-tables and algorithms for insertion and deletion.
- Cuckoo hashing, double hashing and variants.
- Bloom filters and their applications
- Understand how to use hash-tables for sketching over streaming data.

#### Programming Assignment
- **Hash Applications**

### Week 5 | Final Exam

- I have completed a programming assignment worth 16% of my grade.
- The assignment is intended to reflect learned knowledge through out the course. Such as Computational Complexity Analysis, Heap Data Structures, Quicksort and Hash Functions, and Hash Applications.
