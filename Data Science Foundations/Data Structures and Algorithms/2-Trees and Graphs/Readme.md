# Trees and Graphs - Basics[<sup>[1]</sup>](#reference-1)				

## Brief Description
- Basic algorithms on tree data structures, binary search trees, self-balancing trees, graph data structures and basic traversal algorithms on graphs. This course also covers advanced topics such as kd-trees for spatial data and algorithms for spatial data.

## Prior knowledge needed: 

### [Algorithms for Searching Sorting and Indexing](https://github.com/laithrasheed/MSDS_Program_Private/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Foundations/Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms/1-Algorithms%20for%20Searching%20Sorting%20and%20Indexing)

### Mathematical Background: 
We expect that the student is comfortable with basic mathematics at the level of a U.S. first-year college STEM student. This includes basic notions such as sets and functions: Properties of sets, definition and properties of functions; logarithms and exponentials: and their properties; basic series summations: arithmetic and geometric series summations; and probability theory: basic definition of probability, independence of events, probability distributions and expectations.  CLRS has a helpful appendix but the student unfamiliar with these concepts can find numerous high quality explanations online.

### Programming Background: 
The course involves solving programming assignments in Python. You must be comfortable with Python programming. This includes basic control structures in Python: conditional branches, for loops and recursion; functions: defining and calling functions, and recursion; in-built data structures: lists and dictionaries; and classes. Our use of Python will get more sophisticated as the course progresses to accommodate some learning of Python.
