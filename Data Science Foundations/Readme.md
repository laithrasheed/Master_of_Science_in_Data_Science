# Data Science Foundations

**The two pathway specializations representing foundation for the MSDS Degree are *Data Structures and Algorithms* and *Statistical Inference***




## Statistical Inference


**The specialization consists of three courses:**

### [(1) Probability Theory - Foundation to Data Science](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Foundations/Statistical%20Inference/Probability%20Theory%20-%20Foundation%20to%20Data%20Science)

- I have completed a proctored exam worth 22% of my grade made up of multiple choice and free response questions.


### [(2) Statistical Inference for Estimation in Data Science](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Foundations/Statistical%20Inference/Statistical%20Inference%20for%20Estimation%20in%20Data%20Science)

- I have completed a proctored exam worth 20% of your grade made up of multiple choice and free response questions.

### [(3) Statistical Inference and Hypothesis Testing in Data Science Applications](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Foundations/Statistical%20Inference/Statistical%20Inference%20and%20Hypothesis%20Testing%20in%20Data%20Science%20Applications)

- I have completed a proctored exam worth 21% of my grade made up of multiple choice and free response questions.



## Data Structures and Algorithms


**The specialization consists of three courses:**

### [(1) Algorithms for Searching Sorting and Indexing](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Foundations/Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms/1-Algorithms%20for%20Searching%20Sorting%20and%20Indexing)

- I have completed a programming assignment worth 16% of my grade.
- The assignment is intended to reflect learned knowledge through out the course. Such as Computational Complexity Analysis, Heap Data Structures, Quicksort and Hash Functions, and Hash Applications.


### [(2) Trees and Graphs](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Foundations/Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms/2-Trees%20and%20Graphs)

- I have completed a programming assignment worth 17% of my grade.
-  The assignment is intended to reflect learned knowledge through out the course. Such as Binary Search Trees, Basics of Graphs and Graphs Traversals, Spanning Trees and Union-Find Data Structure, and Shortest Path Algorithms

### [(3) Dynamic Programming and Greedy Algorithms](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Foundations/Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms/3-Dynamic%20Programming%20and%20Greedy%20Algorithms)

- I have completed a programming assignment worth 10% of my grade.
- The assignment is intended to reflect learned knowledge through out the course. Such as Divide and Conquer Algorithms, Dynamic Programming Algorithms, Greedy Algorithms, and Intractability and Supplement in Quantum Computing.
