# Statistical Inference


**The specialization consists of three courses:**

## [(1) Probability Theory - Foundation to Data Science](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Foundations/Statistical%20Inference/Probability%20Theory%20-%20Foundation%20to%20Data%20Science)

- I have completed a proctored exam worth 22% of my grade made up of multiple choice and free response questions.


## [(2) Statistical Inference for Estimation in Data Science](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Foundations/Statistical%20Inference/Statistical%20Inference%20for%20Estimation%20in%20Data%20Science)

- I have completed a proctored exam worth 20% of your grade made up of multiple choice and free response questions.
