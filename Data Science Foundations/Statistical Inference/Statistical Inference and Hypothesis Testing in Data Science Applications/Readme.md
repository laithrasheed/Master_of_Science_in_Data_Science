# Statistical Inference and Hypothesis Testing in Data Science Applications[<sup>[1]</sup>](#reference-1)				

## Brief Description
- This course will focus on theory and implementation of hypothesis testing, especially as it relates to applications in data science. Students will learn to use hypothesis tests to make informed decisions from data. Special attention will be given to the general logic of hypothesis testing, error and error rates, power, simulation, and the correct computation and interpretation of p-values. Attention will also be given to the misuse of testing concepts, especially p-values, and the ethical implications of such misuse.

## Course Content

### Week 1 | Fundamental Concepts of Hypothesis Testing

In this module, we will define a hypothesis test and develop the intuition behind designing a test. We will learn the language of hypothesis testing, which includes definitions of a null hypothesis, an alternative hypothesis, and the level of significance of a test. We will walk through a very simple test.

#### Learning Objectives

- Define a statistical hypothesis, a null hypothesis, an alternative hypothesis, and a simple/composite hypothesis.
- Describe and interpret errors in hypothesis testing.
- Define a test statistic, level of significance, and the rejection region for a hypothesis test. Give the form of a rejection region.
- Complete a simple hypothesis test with an emphasis on intuition.
- Carry out one-tailed tests involving the mean of a normal distribution.

### Week 2 | Composite Tests, Power Functions, and P-Values

In this module, we will expand the lessons of Module 1 to composite hypotheses for both one and two-tailed tests. We will define the “power function” for a test and discuss its interpretation and how it can lead to the idea of a “uniformly most powerful” test. We will discuss and interpret “p-values” as an alternate approach to hypothesis testing.

#### Learning Objectives

- Correctly use and interpret p-values in hypothesis testing.
- Carry out one and two-tailed tests involving the mean of a normal distribution.
- Use power functions and state what it means for a test to be "powerful" and "uniformly most powerful".
- Define a composite hypothesis and the level of significance for a test with a composite null hypothesis.
- Use qq-plots to check a sample for normality.

### Week 3 | t-Tests and Two Samples Tests

In this module, we will learn about the chi-squared and t distributions and their relationships to sampling distributions. We will learn to identify when hypothesis tests based on these distributions are appropriate. We will review the concept of sample variance and derive the “t-test”. Additionally, we will derive our first two-sample test and apply it to make some decisions about real data.

#### Learning Objectives

- Derive and perform a two-sample test to compare population proportions.
- Perform a two-sample test for means.
- Derive a small sample test for the mean of a normal distribution in the case that the variance is unknown.
- Define the “sample variance” and learn about some of its theoretical properties and its importance in hypothesis testing.
- Define the t and chi-squared distributions and their roles in hypothesis testing.

### Week 4 | Beyond Normality

In this module, we will consider some problems where the assumption of an underlying normal distribution is not appropriate and will expand our ability to construct hypothesis tests for this case. We will define the concept of a “uniformly most powerful” (UMP) test, whether or not such a test exists for specific problems, and we will revisit some of our earlier tests from Modules 1 and 2 through the UMP lens. We will also introduce the F-distribution and its role in testing whether or not two population variances are equal.

#### Learning Objectives

- Derive a test for a normal population variance.
- Perform a UMP test using the Neyman-Pearson Lemma.
- Define the uniformly most powerful (UMP) test and determine when it exists.
- Compare two different approaches to one hypothesis test with power functions.
- Compute the sampling distributions for the sample mean and sample minimum of the exponential distribution.
- Perform tests to compare two population variances.
- Perform tests concerning a true population variance.
- Derive a "best test" using the Neyman-Pearson Lemma.

### Week 5 |  Likelihood Ratio Tests and Chi-Squared Tests

In this module, we develop a formal approach to hypothesis testing, based on a “likelihood ratio” that can be more generally applied than any of the tests we have discussed so far. We will pay special attention to the large sample properties of the likelihood ratio, especially Wilks’ Theorem, that will allow us to come up with approximate (but easy) tests when we have a large sample size. We will close the course with two chi-squared tests that can be used to test whether the distributional assumptions we have been making throughout this course are valid.

#### Learning Objectives

- Perform a chi-squared test for independence of two populations.
- Define and carry out a chi-squared "goodness of fit" test.
- Use Wilks' Theorem to carry out approximate large sample GLRTs when no exact test is available.
- Develop a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT).
- Define and compute a "generalized likelihood ratio".
- Develop tests with non-traditional statistics.
- Derive maximum likelihood estimators.

### Week 6 | Final Exam

You will complete a proctored exam worth 21% of your grade made up of multiple choice and free response questions. You must attempt the final in order to earn a grade in the course. If you've upgraded to the for-credit version of this course, please make sure you review the additional for-credit materials in the Introductory module and anywhere else they may be found.
