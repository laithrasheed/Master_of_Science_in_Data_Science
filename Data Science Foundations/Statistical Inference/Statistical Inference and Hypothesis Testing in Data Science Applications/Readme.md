# Statistical Inference and Hypothesis Testing in Data Science Applications[<sup>[1]</sup>](#reference-1)				

## Brief Description
- This course will focus on theory and implementation of hypothesis testing, especially as it relates to applications in data science. Students will learn to use hypothesis tests to make informed decisions from data. Special attention will be given to the general logic of hypothesis testing, error and error rates, power, simulation, and the correct computation and interpretation of p-values. Attention will also be given to the misuse of testing concepts, especially p-values, and the ethical implications of such misuse.

## Learning Outcomes

- Define a composite hypothesis and the level of significance for a test with a composite null hypothesis.
- Define a test statistic, level of significance, and the rejection region for a hypothesis test. Give the form of a rejection region.
- Perform tests concerning a true population variance.
- Compute the sampling distributions for the sample mean and sample minimum of the exponential distribution.
