# Probability Theory - Foundation to Data Science[<sup>[1]</sup>](#reference-1)				

## Brief Description
- Probability Theory covers the foundations of probability and its relationship to statistics and data science. Calculate a probability, independent and dependent outcomes, and conditional events. Understand discrete and continuous random variables and see how this fits with data collection. Learn Gaussian (normal) random variables and the Central Limit Theorem and understand it’s fundamental importance for statistics and data science.

## Course Content

### Week 1 |  Descriptive Statistics and Axioms of Probability

Understand the foundation of probability and its relationship to statistics and data science. We’ll learn what it means to calculate a probability, independent and dependent outcomes, and conditional events. We’ll study discrete and continuous random variables and see how this fits with data collection. We’ll end the course with Gaussian (normal) random variables and the Central Limit Theorem and understand it’s fundamental importance for all of statistics and data science.

#### Learning Objectives
- Explain what it means to predict the outcome of an experiment.
- Explain why probability is important to statistics and data science.
- Organize outcomes of experiments into sample spaces using the Axioms of Probability.

### Week 2 | Conditional Probability

The notion of “conditional probability” is a very useful concept from Probability Theory and in this module we introduce the idea of “conditioning” and Bayes’ Formula. The fundamental concept of “independent event” then naturally arises from the notion of conditioning. Conditional and independent events are fundamental concepts in understanding statistical results.

#### Learning Objectives
- Explain the concept of conditional probability.
- Calculate probabilities using conditioning and Bayes Theorem.
- Explain the concepts of independence and mutually exclusive events and provide examples.
- See the relationship between conditional and independent events in a statistical experiment.

### Week 3 |  Discrete Random Variables

The concept of a “random variable” (r.v.) is fundamental and often used in statistics. In this module we’ll study various named discrete random variables. We’ll learn some of their properties and why they are important. We’ll also calculate the expectation and variance for these random variables.

#### Learning Objectives

- Define a discrete random variable and understand a probability mass function.
- Calculate the expectation and variance of several discrete random variables (e.g. Bernoulli, geometric, negative binomial) and develop intuition for when each applies.
- Demonstrate understanding of a binomial random variable by calculating its probability mass function, expectation, and variance.

### Week 4 |  Continous Random Variables

In this module, we’ll extend our definition of random variables to include continuous random variables. The concepts in this unit are crucial since a substantial portion of statistics deals with the analysis of continuous random variables. We’ll begin with uniform and exponential random variables and then study Gaussian, or normal, random variables.

#### Learning Objectives

- Explain the difference between a continuous random variable and a discrete random variable.
- Calculate probabilities, expectations, and variances of continuous r.v.'s using the probability density function or cumulative distribution function of a random variable.
- Identify and discuss common random variables such as the uniform r.v. or the exponential.

### Week 5 |  Joint Distributions and Covariance

The power of statistics lies in being able to study the outcomes and effects of multiple random variables (i.e. sometimes referred to as “data”). Thus, in this module, we’ll learn about the concept of “joint distribution” which allows us to generalize probability theory to the multivariate case.

#### Learning Objectives

- Explain the concept of jointly distributed random variables in the continuous and discrete cases and calculate probabilities for each.
- Calculate the covariance and correlation of jointly distributed random variables.

### Week 6 |  The Central Limit Theorem

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a crucial result used in the analysis of data. In this module, we’ll introduce the CLT and it’s applications such as characterizing the distribution of the mean of a large data set. This will set the stage for the next course.

#### Learning Objectives

- Understand the relationship between a normal r.v. and a standard normal and be able to calculate probabilities associated with each type.
- Calculate z-scores and probabilities of events related to experiments modeled by a normal r.v.
- Summarize the statement of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and explain the implications of the CLT to the calculation and estimation of the sample mean.

### Week 7 | Final Exam

You will complete a proctored exam worth 22% of your grade made up of made up of multiple choice and free response questions. You must attempt the final in order to earn a grade in the course. If you've upgraded to the for-credit version of this course, please make sure you review the additional for-credit materials in the Introductory module and anywhere else they may be found.
