# Probability Theory - Foundation to Data Science[<sup>[1]</sup>](#reference-1)				

## Brief Description
- Probability Theory covers the foundations of probability and its relationship to statistics and data science. Calculate a probability, independent and dependent outcomes, and conditional events. Understand discrete and continuous random variables and see how this fits with data collection. Learn Gaussian (normal) random variables and the Central Limit Theorem and understand itâ€™s fundamental importance for statistics and data science.

## Prior knowledge needed: 

## Learning Outcomes

- Explain why probability is important to statistics and data science.
- See the relationship between conditional and independent events in a statistical experiment.
- Calculate the expectation and variance of several random variables and develop some intuition.

## Resources

- This course use the online open source textbook[Probability](https://bookdown.org/probability/beta/)
