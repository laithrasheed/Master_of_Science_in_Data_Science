# Statistical Inference for Estimation in Data Science[<sup>[1]</sup>](#reference-1)				

## Brief Description
- Introduction to statistical inference, sampling distributions, and confidence intervals. Learn how to define and construct good estimators, method of moments estimation, maximum likelihood estimation, and methods of constructing confidence intervals that will extend to more general settings.
