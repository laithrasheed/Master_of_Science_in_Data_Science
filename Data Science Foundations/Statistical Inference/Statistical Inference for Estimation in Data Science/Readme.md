## Course Content

### Week 1 | Point Estimation

In this module you will learn how to estimate parameters from a large population based only on information from a small sample. You will learn about desirable properties that can be used to help you to differentiate between good and bad estimators. We will review the concepts of expectation, variance, and covariance, and you will be introduced to a formal, yet intuitive, method of estimation known as the "method of moments".

#### Learning Objectives

- Apply the skills you learned in Module 2!
- Explain the fundamental idea behind the concept of statistical inference and point estimation.
- Learn (or review) some basic concepts about random variables and distributions.
- Describe good qualities of estimators including the concepts of “unbiased estimation” and small variance.
- Construct "method of moments" estimators.
- Learn how to find distributions of transformations of random variables.
- Learn or review basic expectation and variance calculations

### Week 2 | Maximum Likelihood Estimation

In this module we will learn what a likelihood function is and the concept of maximum likelihood estimation. We will construct maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) for one and two parameter examples and functions of parameters using the invariance property of MLEs.

#### Learning Objectives

- Understand the concepts and principles of maximum likelihood estimation.
- Compute maximum likelihood estimators for one parameter distributions.
- Find MLEs for functions of parameters using the invariance property of MLEs.
- Find MLEs for distributions with multiple parameters and parameters involved in distribution supports.
- Interpret and compute the mean-squared error for comparing estimators.

### Week 3 | Large Sample Properties of Maximum Likelihood Estimation

In this module we will explore large sample properties of maximum likelihood estimators including asymptotic unbiasedness and asymptotic normality. We will learn how to compute the “Cramér–Rao lower bound” which gives us a benchmark for the smallest possible variance for an unbiased estimator.

#### Learning Objectives

- Apply the skills that you learned in Module 4!
- Understand the concepts and principles of maximum likelihood estimation.
- Compute maximum likelihood estimators for one parameter distributions.
- Understand the large sample properties of maximum likelihood estimation.
- Find lower bounds on the variance of possible estimators.

### Week 4 |  Confidence Intervals Involving the Normal Distribution

In this module we learn about the theory of “interval estimation”. We will learn the definition and correct interpretation of a confidence interval and how to construct one for the mean of an unseen population based on both large and small samples. We will look at the cases where the variance is known and unknown.

#### Learning Objectives

- Define the chi-squared and t distributions.
- Understand the relationship between the t, chi-squared, and normal distributions.
- Define the sample variance and be able to find its distribution for a normal population.
- Properly interpret a confidence interval (CI) and explain common misconceptions about CIs.
- Construct confidence intervals for population means.
- Understand when and where to use the t-distribution for a confidence interval.
- Construct confidence intervals for differences between population means.

### Week 5 |  Beyond Normality: Confidence Intervals Unleashed!

In this module, we will generalize the lessons of Module 4 so that we can develop confidence intervals for other quantities of interest beyond the distribution mean and for other distributions entirely. This module covers two sample confidence intervals in more depth, and confidence intervals for population variances and proportions. We will also learn how to develop confidence intervals for parameters of interest in non-normal distributions.

#### Learning Objectives

- Demonstrate mastery of the material presented in this course.
- Understand the F-distribution and how it is defined as a ratio.
- Generalize confidence intervals for non-normal distributions and parameters other than the mean.

#### Programming Assignment

- Quiz Assessments, and Programming Assignment

### Week 6 | Final Exam

You will complete a proctored exam worth 20% of your grade made up of multiple choice and free response questions. You must attempt the final in order to earn a grade in the course. If you've upgraded to the for-credit version of this course, please make sure you review the additional for-credit materials in the Introductory module and anywhere else they may be found.
