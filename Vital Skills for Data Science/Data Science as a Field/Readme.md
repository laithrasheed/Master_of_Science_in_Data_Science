# Data Science as a Field [<sup>[1]</sup>](#reference-1)				

## Brief Description
- This course provides a general introduction to the field of Data Science. It is designed for aspiring data scientists, content experts who work with data scientists, or anyone interested in learning about what Data Science is and what it’s used for. Weekly topics include the past, present, and future of the field; the academic disciplines that both practice and make use of Data Science; collaboration between data scientists and content experts; and the practice of Data Science in the professional world. This course is part of CU Boulder’s Master’s of Science in Data Science and was collaboratively designed by both academics and industry professionals to provide learners with an insider’s perspective on this exciting, evolving, and increasingly vital discipline.

## Prior knowledge needed: 

##### Basic knowledge of R programming, and R Studio

## Learning Outcomes

- By taking this course, you will be able explain what data science is and identify the key disciplines involved.
- You will be able to use the steps of the data science process to create a reproducible data analysis and identify personal biases.

## Course Content

### Week 1 | Introduction to Data Science: the Past, Present, and Future of a New Discipline

This week we will talk about the past, present and future of data science. The growth of data science has been fueled by the growth of the internet, social media and online shopping as well as by the rapid increases in data storage capabilities. You will watch several short videos and participate in discussions about the future of data science.

#### Learning Objectives

- Identify the background of data science
- Discuss where data science is going in the future
- Communicate the key contributors to the rise of data science

#### Programming Assignment

- Discussion Prompt: Data Science and Privacy Concerns

### Week 2 | Data Science in Industry, Government, and Academia

This week you will watch videos and have a reading on some applications of data science in industry and academia. You will hear from data scientists in different fields to find out how they use data science.

#### Learning Objectives

- Describe several different applications of data science

#### Programming Assignment

- Peer Review Discussion

### Week 3 |  Data Science Process and Pitfalls

This week you will learn about the importance of reproducibility and how to achieve it, learn the steps in a data analysis process and learn about the possible pitfalls in data science. You will watch demonstrating the various steps in the data science process and try out these processes for yourself on a different dataset.

#### Learning Objectives

- Describe the importance of reproducibility and develop reproducible reports
- Understand the steps in the data science process and be able to do a simple data analysis in a reproducible way
- Articulate your bias in a data analysis

#### Programming Assignment

- Peer Review: Applying what have been covered in this modeule about NYPD Shooting Incidents

### Week 4 | Communicating Your Results

This week you will learn about important ways of communicating your results. We will discuss the important things to know about presentations and reports. You will also learn about the importance of networking and try it out.

#### Learning Objectives

- Present your results in a presentation
- Identify imposter syndrome in yourself

#### Programming Assignment

- Peer Review Assignment

### Week 5 |  Final Exam

- I have completed a peer reviewed project worth 20% of my grade.
- The final exam is about an introduction to the Data Science in general. At that level I do not have the full skills to implelemnt a full Data Science project. Such that this project is for preparing me for coming projects in the MSDS degree and be familier on using R especially in RStudio.
- The final exam is about applying step by step the covered proceduere of how to implement a reproducable project using COVID-19 dataset. In addition to that, I was required to apply what I have learned on other dataset which it was NYPD Shooting Incidents Dataset

- In the below table you can find the files of both projects NYPD and COVID-19. 

| Document | Type | Description |
