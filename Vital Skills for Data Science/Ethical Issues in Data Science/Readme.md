# Ethical Issues in Data Science [<sup>[1]</sup>](#reference-1)				

## Brief Description

- This course examines ethical issues related to data science, with the objective of making data science professionals aware of and sensitive to ethical considerations that may arise in their careers. It focuses on ethical frameworks, data science applications that lead to ethical considerations, current media and scholarly articles, and the perspectives and experiences of fellow students and computing professionals.

## Course Content

### Week 1 |  Ethical Foundations

This module begins with an introduction to the course including motivation for the topic, the course goals, what topics the course will cover, and what is expected of the students. It then reviews the three ethical frameworks that are most commonly applied to ethical discussions in data science and computing: Kantianism/deontology, virtue ethics, and utilitarianism. Case studies are used to illustrate the application and properties of these frameworks.

#### Learning Objectives

- State the basic principles of three foundational ethical frameworks
- Apply all three ethical frameworks to real-life ethical situations (in general and in the context of data science)
- Identify which frameworks are most meaningful to individual learners (in general and in the context of data science)

### Week 2 | Internet, Privacy, and Security

This module begins with some background about the Internet, which is the foundation for most of the topics that we study in this course. It then discusses the two most basic ethical issues in using the internet, privacy and security, in the context of data science. It goes through a number of real case studies and examples for each to illustrate the diversity of issues.

#### Learning Objectives

- Identify examples of tensions between services on the internet and privacy
- Identify leading causes and security of computer security breaches
- Define the “right to be forgotten” and be able to analyze its pros and cons
- Describe the relationship between privacy and security and ethical issues in the field of data science

#### Programming Assignment

- Peer Review Discussion

### Week 3 | Professional Ethics

This module provides insight into the ethical issues in the data science profession and workplace (as opposed to technical topics in data science). It starts with discussion of two highly relevant codes of professional ethics, from professional societies in statistics and in computing. It then looks at a variety of recent workplace ethics issues in tech companies. A key part of this module is interviewing a data science professional about ethical issues they have encountered in their career.

#### Learning Objectives

- Identify, access, and apply several professional codes of ethics
- Compare and contrast foundational ethical frameworks with professional codes of ethics
- Anticipate and plan for ethical situations that students may encounter in their professional careers
- Incorporate experiences of professionals in the field into students’ own thinking about ethics in the field

### Week 4 |   Algorithmic Bias

Algorithmic bias may be the topic that people associate most with ethical issues in data science. This module begins by providing some general background on algorithmic bias and considering varying views on the pros and cons of algorithmic vs. human decision making. It then reviews an illustrative set of examples of algorithmic bias related to gender and race, which is a particularly important class of instances of algorithmic bias. The final part of the module discusses what is perhaps the single most prominent and discussed instance of algorithmic decision making and bias, facial recognition.

#### Learning Objectives

- Define algorithmic bias, and identify the technical issues in data science that lead to algorithmic bias
- Recognize and analyze instances of algorithmic bias, settings where it is particularly prone to occur, and mechanisms for avoiding it
- Discuss facial recognition as an important example of algorithmic bias

### Week 5 |   Medical Applications and Implications

Data science is applied to a wide variety of important application areas, each with their own ethical issues. This module focuses on an application area that is both particularly important and leads to a rich set of ethical issues: medical applications. This includes looking at current issues involved with health databases and the uses of artificial intelligence in healthcare, and more futuristic issues, gene editing and neurological interventions. The module concludes with a crucial topic that every data science profession should consider: the implications of the fields of data science and computing on the future of human work.

#### Learning Objectives

- Identify the many ways that data science and computing impact health care
- Explain how data science and computing have the ability to change “human-ness” and how one considers the ethics of those situations
- Analyze the ethical considerations in data science that impact health care
- Evaluate the tradeoffs between advances in data science and computing and human “employability”

#### Programming Assignment

- Quiz

### Week 6 |  Final Exam

You will complete a peer reviewed essay worth 35% of your grade. You must attempt the final in order to earn a grade in the course. If you've upgraded to the for-credit version of this course, please make sure you review the additional for-credit materials in the Introductory module and anywhere else they may be found.
