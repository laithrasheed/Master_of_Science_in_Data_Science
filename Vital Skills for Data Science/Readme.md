# Vital Skills for Data Science


**The specialization consists of four courses:**

### [(1) Data Science as a Field](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/tree/main/Vital%20Skills%20for%20Data%20Science/Data%20Science%20as%20a%20Field)

- I have completed a peer reviewed project worth 20% of my grade.
- The final exam is about an introduction to the Data Science in general. At that level I do not have the full skills to implelemnt a full Data Science project. Such that this project is for preparing me for coming projects in the MSDS degree and be familier on using R especially in RStudio.
- The final exam is about applying step by step the covered proceduere of how to implement a reproducable project using COVID-19 dataset. In addition to that, I was required to apply what I have learned on other dataset which it was NYPD Shooting Incidents Dataset

- In the below table you can find the files of both projects NYPD and COVID-19. 

| Document | Type | Description |
|:------------:|:--------------:|:-------------:|
| [COVID-19 Dataset](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/blob/main/Vital%20Skills%20for%20Data%20Science/Data%20Science%20as%20a%20Field/Final-Project-Submission-of-COVID-19-Data-Set.pdf)       |     PDF      |        The PDF file shows R scripts for the skills applied through out the course using the COVID-19 Dataset    |
| [NYPD Shooting Incidents Dataset](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/blob/main/Vital%20Skills%20for%20Data%20Science/Data%20Science%20as%20a%20Field/NYPD%20Shooting%20Incidents%20Presentation.pdf)       |     PDF      |      The PDF file reflects learning outcomes and applied skills I learned through out the course using the NYPD Shooting incidents dataset   |


### [(2) Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/tree/main/Vital%20Skills%20for%20Data%20Science/Fundamentals%20of%20Data%20Visualization)

- I have completed a peer reviewed project worth 40% of my grade.
- The project is inteneded to reflect fundamental skill I learned during the course, I used **Tableau-Public** to visualize my **EDA** results using the **World Happiness Score 2016 Dataset**. The main reason I chose Tableau over **Alter library in python** is that I can present my story more effectively using Tableau 
- In the below table you can find the PDF file . 

| Document | Type | Description |
|:------------:|:--------------:|:-------------:|
| [Fundamentals of Visualization Using Tableau](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/blob/main/Vital%20Skills%20for%20Data%20Science/Fundamentals%20of%20Data%20Visualization/Final%20Project%20Delivery%20for%20Fundamentals%20of%20Visualization%20Course.pdf)       |     PDF      |        The PDF file shows Story Telling Dashboard using Tableau for the EDA results of the World Happiness Score 2016 Dataset    |


### [(3) Ethical Issues in Data Science](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/tree/main/Vital%20Skills%20for%20Data%20Science/Ethical%20Issues%20in%20Data%20Science)

- I have completed a peer reviewed essay worth 35% of my grade.
- The essay is about discussing with my peers about **Ethical Issues of Using AI in the Healthcare Field**


### [(4) Cybersecurity for Data Science](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/tree/main/Vital%20Skills%20for%20Data%20Science/Cybersecurity%20for%20Data%20Science)

- I have completed a peer reviewed project worth 28% of my grade.
- The Final project is consisted of two separate parts. The first part is about presenting a **MEMO**  to the cybersecurity public, describing technically how the attakers approached to their target and accessed sensitive data.
- The second part of the project is about asking 5 questions I would to ask and discuss with a real cybersecurity practitioner. Note that the project was intended to have a real discussion and answers from the proposed cybersecurity practitioner, but I could not conduct a real conversation and I clarified that to my peers, as I could not find a cybersecurity practitioner in MeetUP in my country. 
- Below table shows documents and presentations for both parts of the final exam.

| Document | Type | Description |
|:------------:|:--------------:|:-------------:|
| [Presenting a MEMO to Cybersecurity Public](https://youtu.be/ikZQ21sH4qE)       |     MP4      |        Recorded presentation to the cybersecurity public about hacking sensitive data in WHO )    |
| [Cybersecurity MEMO](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/blob/main/Vital%20Skills%20for%20Data%20Science/Cybersecurity%20for%20Data%20Science/Cybersecurity%20MEMO.pdf) | PDF | The file shows a written MEMO by me that is directed to the Cybersecurity public |
| [Presentation of 5 Question I would ask to a cybersecurity practitioner](https://youtu.be/IBS8otIF6M8) | MP4 | Recorded Presenation about 5 questions I would ask for a cybersecurity practitioner |
