### Week 6 |  Final Exam

- I have completed a peer reviewed project worth 28% of my grade.
- The Final project is consisted of two separate parts. The first part is about presenting a **MEMO**  to the cybersecurity public, describing technically how the attakers approached to their target and accessed sensitive data.
- The second part of the project is about asking 5 questions I would to ask and discuss with a real cybersecurity practitioner. Note that the project was intended to have a real discussion and answers from the proposed cybersecurity practitioner, but I could not conduct a real conversation and I clarified that to my peers, as I could not find a cybersecurity practitioner in MeetUP in my country. 
- Below table shows documents and presentations for both parts of the final exam.

| Document | Type | Description |
|:------------:|:--------------:|:-------------:|
| [Presenting a MEMO to Cybersecurity Public](https://youtu.be/ikZQ21sH4qE)       |     MP4      |        Recorded presentation to the cybersecurity public about hacking sensitive data in WHO )    |
| [Cybersecurity MEMO](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/blob/main/Vital%20Skills%20for%20Data%20Science/Cybersecurity%20for%20Data%20Science/Cybersecurity%20MEMO.pdf) | PDF | The file shows a written MEMO by me that is directed to the Cybersecurity public |
