# Fundamentals of Data Visualization [<sup>[1]</sup>](#reference-1)				

## Brief Description

- Fundamentals of Visualization explores the design, development, and evaluation of information visualizations. Combine aspects of design, computer graphics, HCI, and data science, to gain hands-on experience with creating visualizations, using exploratory tools, and architecting data narratives. Topics include user-centered design, web-based visualization, data cognition and perception, and design evaluation.


## Prior knowledge needed: 

##### [Data Science Foundations](https://github.com/laithrasheed/MSDS_Program_Private/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Foundations)
##### Python, Basic statistics

## Learning Outcomes

- Develop a toolkit for exploring and communicating complex data using visualization
- Produce basic data visualizations using a chosen dataset
- Compare methods for visualizing data and understand how these methods may guide users towards different conclusions
- Evaluate how effectively a visualization conveys target data

## Course Content

### Week 1 |   Basics of Design

In this module, you will learn the foundations of visualization design. You will walk through the key components of a visualization, how we effectively represent data using channels like color, size, and position, and some ground rules for honest and effective visualization. You will also gain preliminary exposure to Altair, a Python library for rapidly generating interactive visualizations. Each week will also include either two readings or one reading and one notebook activity.

#### Learning Objectives

- Identify different techniques for mapping data to visual elements.
- Describe trade-offs between different ways of mapping data to visual values.
- Detect common ineffective or misleading practices in visualizations.
- Create basic interactive visualizations in Altair.
- Choose between different tools for creating visualizations.

#### Programming Assignment

- Quiz

### Week 2 | User Needs

In this module, you will learn how to choose the right visualization for a given scenario. You will learn how to reason about the different kinds of questions people ask with visualization and, how to align your design with that task. The module will cover basics of task analysis, methods for task elicitation, and foundational knowledge of visual perception for design. Each week will also include two external readings or one reading and one notebook activity.

#### Learning Objectives

- Determine the kinds of tasks a stakeholder wants to accomplish using a visualization.
- Design visualizations specifically tailored to a given problem and dataset.
- Work with stakeholders to determine how the visualizations can best suit their needs.
- Determine how the visual representation of data changes a visualizationâ€™s abilities to support different tasks.
- Demonstrate how visualization design might influence subsequent actions beyond estimating statistical values.

#### Programming Assignment

- Quiz

### Week 3 | Evaluation

In this module, you will learn how to assess the effectiveness of your visualization. You will learn both qualitative and quantitative approaches for evaluating visualizations as well as how to isolate key elements for assessment and iteration. The module will cover basics of insight-based evaluation, interview studies, and experimental design and analysis. Each week will also include two external readings or one reading and one notebook activity.

#### Learning Objectives

- Choose between different methods for assessing the utility of a visualization.
- Use the results of an evaluation to drive future improvements for the visualization.
- Execute qualitative studies to investigate how well a visualization supports a set of goals.
- Design and conduct quantitative studies to measure trade-offs in different visualization approaches.
- Identify the set of factors that are necessary to drive an experimental design.

#### Programming Assignment

- Quiz


### Week 4 |  Final Exam

- I have completed a peer reviewed project worth 40% of my grade.
- The project is inteneded to reflect fundamental skill I learned during the course, I used **Tableau-Public** to visualize my **EDA** results using the **World Happiness Score 2016 Dataset**. The main reason I chose Tableau over **Alter library in python** is that I can present my story more effectively using Tableau 
- In the below table you can find the PDF file .
