# Unsupervised Algorithms in Machine Learning [<sup>[1]</sup>](#reference-1)				

## Brief Description

- In this course, I have learned about selected unsupervised learning methods for dimensionality reduction, clustering, finding latent features, and application cases such as recommender systems with hands-on examples of product recommendation algorithms.

### Week 5 |  Final Exam

- I have completed a peer reviewed final project worth 30% of my grade.
- The final project is about applying an Unsupervised ML Algorithm to a real dataset. I have selected the [Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python?datasetId=42674) that is hosted on Kaggle, where the goal is to get insights about the Mall's customers. Thus, I selected Clustering technique using KNN Algorithm (K-Nearest-Neighbor). Insights and Foundings are presented in the Recorded Presenation alongside with the Jupyter Notebook of the project in the Cluster Analysis section.
-  In the below table you can find the Recorded Presenation, Jupyter Notebook, and Slides as a PDF file.
