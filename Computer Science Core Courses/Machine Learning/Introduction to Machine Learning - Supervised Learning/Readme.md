# Introduction to Machine Learning - Supervised Learning [<sup>[1]</sup>](#reference-1)				

## Brief Description

- In this course  I have learned various supervised ML algorithms and prediction tasks applied to different data. I knew when to use which model and why, and how to improve the model performances. The course covered models such as linear and logistic regression, KNN, Decision trees and ensembling methods such as Random Forest and Boosting, kernel methods such as SVM.

### Week 7 |  Final Exam

- I have completed a peer reviewed final project worth 33% of my grade.
- The final project is about applying a Supervised ML Algorithm to a real dataset. I have selected the [Cement Manufacturing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinayakshanawad/cement-manufacturing-concrete-dataset?datasetId=1459683) that is hosted on Kaggle, where the goal is to predict the compressive strenght of a concrete mixture based on the provided features of the dataset.
- In the below table you can find the Recorded Presenation, Jupyter Notebook, and Slides as a PDF file.
