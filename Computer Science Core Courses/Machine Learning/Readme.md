# Machine Learning

The Machine Learning specialization covers Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and the basics of Deep Learning. I have applied ML algorithms to real-world data, learned when to use which model and why, and improved the performance of my models. Starting with supervised learning, I have learned about linear and logistic regression, KNN, Decision trees, ensembling methods such as Random Forest and Boosting, and kernel methods such as SVM. In the second course, I learned about unsupervised methods, including dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA & LDA, clustering, and recommender systems. Finally in the third course, I have learned about deep learning basics, including choosing model architectures, building/training neural networks with libraries like Keras, and hands-on examples of CNNs and RNNs. 

**The specialization consists of three courses:**

### [(1) Introduction to Machine Learning - Supervised Learning](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/tree/main/Computer%20Science%20Core%20Courses/Machine%20Learning/Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Supervised%20Learning)

- I have completed a peer reviewed final project worth 33% of my grade.
- The final project is about applying a Supervised ML Algorithm to a real dataset. I have selected the [Cement Manufacturing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinayakshanawad/cement-manufacturing-concrete-dataset?datasetId=1459683) that is hosted on Kaggle, where the goal is to predict the compressive strenght of a concrete mixture based on the provided features of the dataset.
