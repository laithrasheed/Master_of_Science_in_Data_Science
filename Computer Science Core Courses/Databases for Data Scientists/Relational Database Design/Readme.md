- Quiz and Peer Reviewed Assignment

### Week 2 |  Relational Models

Introduce the concepts about relational models. Train students on how to convert a conceptual entity relationship model to a relational model..

#### Learning Objectives

- Be able to explain what a relational model is
- Be able to use relational schemas to represent a relational model
- Understanding the key properties of Relations
- Be able to convert ERDs to Relational Models

#### Programming Assignment

- Quiz and Peer Reviewed Assignment

### Week 3 | Normalization

Introduce students with the reasons and process of normalization. Train students with skills to normalize a relational model to 3NF..

#### Learning Objectives

- Be able to explain the need for normalization
- Be able to explain functional dependencies, full/partial FDs, and transitive FDs
- Be able to explain different forms of normalization, and normalize a relational model to 3NF
- Understanding and utilize the definition of Normal Forms.

#### Programming Assignment

- Quiz and Peer Review

### Week 4 | Case Study

A summary of the knowledge we learned in this course, starting from an Entity Relationship Model to a Relational Model in 3NF and ready for implementation.

#### Learning Objectives

- Be able to follow through the case study and understand every step
- Be able to build an individal-interested project based on the same process

### Week 5 |  Final Exam

- I have completed a peer reviewed project worth 20% of my grade.
- The project is about designing a Relational Model from scratch. I selected the **Amman Bus Rapid Transit** as a case study.  
- In the below table you can find the recorded presenation and the relational model PDF file.
