# Databases for Data Scientists 

**In this specialization I learned about database design, and how to use the Structured Query Language (SQL) to work with databases. Upon completion of this specialization I am well prepared to design and create efficient and effective relational databases, fill them with data, and work with them using SQL.**

**The specialization consists of two courses:**

### [(1) Relational Database Design](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/tree/main/Computer%20Science%20Core%20Courses/Databases%20for%20Data%20Scientists/Relational%20Database%20Design)

- I have completed a peer reviewed project worth 20% of my grade.
- The project is about designing a Relational Model from scratch. I selected the **Amman Bus Rapid Transit** as a case study.  
- In the below table you can find the recorded presenation and the relational model PDF file.

- I have completed a peer reviewed  project worth 50% of my grade.
- The project is about creating 3 Analytical Questions from my own about the Northwinds Relational Database Model that using PostgresSQL. 
- In the below table you can find the PDF file that shows these 3 SQL Queries associated with their Questions.
