### Week 3  |  Clustering

This module introduces unsupervised learning, clustering, and covers several core clustering methods including partitioning, hierarchical, grid-based, density-based, and probabilistic clustering. Advanced topics for high-dimensional clustering, bi-clustering, graph clustering, and constraint-based clustering are also discussed.

#### Learning Objectives

- Apply techniques for clustering and explain how they work.
- Evaluate and compare clustering methods.

#### Programming Assignment
