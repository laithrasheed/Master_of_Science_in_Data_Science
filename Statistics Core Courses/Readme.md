# Statistics Core Courses

**Statistics Science Core Courses consist of only one specializations. Which is: Statistical Modeling for Data Science Applications**


## [Statistical Modeling for Data Science Applications](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/tree/main/Statistics%20Core%20Courses/Statistical%20Modeling%20for%20Data%20Science%20Applications)


**The specialization consists of three courses:**


### [(1) Modern Regression Analysis in R](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/tree/main/Statistics%20Core%20Courses/Statistical%20Modeling%20for%20Data%20Science%20Applications/Modern%20Regression%20Analysis%20in%20R#reference-1)

- I have completed a proctored exam worth 20% of my grade made up of multiple choice questions.


### [(2) ANOVA and Experimental Design](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/tree/main/Statistics%20Core%20Courses/Statistical%20Modeling%20for%20Data%20Science%20Applications/ANOVA%20and%20Experimental%20Design)

- I have completed a proctored exam worth 20% of my grade made up of multiple choice questions.
