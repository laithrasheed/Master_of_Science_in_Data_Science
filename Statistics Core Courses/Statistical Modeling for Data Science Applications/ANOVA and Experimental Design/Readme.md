# ANOVA and Experimental Design [<sup>[1]</sup>](#reference-1)				

## Brief Description

- Introduction to the analysis of variance (ANOVA), analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and experimental design. ANOVA and ANCOVA, presented as a type of linear regression model, provide mathematical basis for designing experiments for data science applications. Emphasis placed on important design-related concepts, such as randomization, blocking, factorial design, and causality.

## Course Content

### Week 1   |  Introduction to ANOVA and Experimental Design


#### Learning Objectives

- Define and interpret the ANCOVA model with interaction terms.
- Conduct basic hypothesis tests (full F-test, individual t-tests) to check whether there are statistically significant differences— with respect to the mean of a continuous variable—across groups.
- Identify and interpret the one-way ANOVA (and ANCOVA) model(s) as a linear regression model.
- Define the one-way (single-factor) ANOVA model, and write the model in two different but equivalent ways: as a means model and effects model.
- Describe some basic principles of experimental design and differentiate between an observational study and an experiment.
- Describe and identify the sums of squares that result from a one-way ANOVA model, and partition the total sum of squares of the one-way ANOVA model.

### Week 2 |  Hypothesis Testing in the ANOVA Context


#### Learning Objectives

- Describe the best practices for conducting tests beyond the full F-test in the one-way ANOVA context.
- Describe the difference between planned comparisons and post hoc (unplanned) comparisons.
- Define a contrast and an orthogonal contrast.
- Describe what contrasts are used for, and derive the distribution of a contrast of interest.
- Conduct planned comparison hypothesis tests (based on contrasts) to check whether there are statistically significant differences— with respect to the mean of a continuous variable—across groups.
- Use Tukey’s method and the Bonferroni correction to conduct post hoc comparisons.
- Conduct prospective and retrospective power analyses in the ANOVA context.
- Use the concepts from this module to answer research questions using real data.

- Interpret the two-way ANOVA model, with and without interaction terms.
- Construct and interpret interaction plots to visually assess the importance of an interaction term.
- Conduct hypothesis tests to decide whether a two-way ANOVA interaction term is statistically significant.
- Use the two-way ANOVA and ANCOVA models to answer research questions using real data.
