# Generalized Linear Models and Nonparametric Regression [<sup>[1]</sup>](#reference-1)				

## Brief Description

In this course I learned about an introduction to classification through logistic regression, nonparametric modeling, including kernel estimators, smoothing splines, and semi-parametric generalized additive models (GAMs). Emphasis was  placed on a firm conceptual understanding of these tools.

### Week 1   |  An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models Through Binomial Regression


#### Learning Objectives

- State the assumptions required for the correct application of standard linear regression (covered in course 1).
- Describe how to generalize the linear model framework to accommodate data that is not suitable for the standard linear regression model.
- Describe why a standard linear regression model will not work well for binomial data.
- Identify the three components of GLMs: an exponential family response variable, a linear predictor and link function.
- Describe two important link functions associated with binomial regression.
- Derive the likelihood function for binomial regression and describe how it is used in parameter estimation.
- Interpret the parameters that show up in binomial regression with the logistic link function.
- Analyze binomial data in R.
- Explain how feedback loops arise in statistical modeling; articulate some ethical issues that arise from these feedback loops.
- Describe why the basic process of variable measurement is not as straightforward as it might at first seem; articulate some ethical issues that arise from difficulties related to measurement.
- Analyze the components of the “machine learning loop” and articulate its relevance to statistical modeling.
- Describe how statistical and machine learning models can lead to demographic disparities.
- Articulate the tradeoffs between human judgement and judgements made by statistical models.

#### Learning Objectives

- Compare and contrast nonparametric smoothing methods.
- Implement and interpret the loess smoother in R.
- Write the objective function (function to be minimized) in smoothing spline regression, and describe how this function strikes a balance between goodness of fit and smoothness of the solution.
- Describe smoothing splines as an alternative to kernel estimation.
- Implement kernel smoothing in R and interpret the results.
- Describe the sensitivity of the kernel estimator as a function of bandwidth and choice of kernel.

- Define a kernel in the context of kernel estimation/smoothing, and be able to identify important kernels used in kernel estimators.
- Define a kernel estimator as a nonparametric regression technique.
- Articulate the advantages and disadvantages of nonparametric statistical models.
- Define parametric and nonparametric statistical models.
