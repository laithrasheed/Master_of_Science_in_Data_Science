# Statistical Modeling for Data Science Applications

**Upon completion of this specialization I became proficient in the theory and application of linear regression analysis, ANOVA and experimental design, and generalized linear and additive models. Emphasis was placed on analyzing real data using the R programming language**

**The specialization consists of three courses:**

### [(1) Modern Regression Analysis in R](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/tree/main/Statistics%20Core%20Courses/Statistical%20Modeling%20for%20Data%20Science%20Applications/Modern%20Regression%20Analysis%20in%20R#reference-1)

- I have completed a proctored exam worth 20% of my grade made up of multiple choice questions.


### [(2) ANOVA and Experimental Design](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/tree/main/Statistics%20Core%20Courses/Statistical%20Modeling%20for%20Data%20Science%20Applications/ANOVA%20and%20Experimental%20Design)

- I have completed a proctored exam worth 20% of my grade made up of multiple choice questions.

### [(3) Generalized Linear Models and Nonparametric Regression](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/tree/main/Statistics%20Core%20Courses/Statistical%20Modeling%20for%20Data%20Science%20Applications/Generalized%20Linear%20Models%20and%20Nonparametric%20Regression)

- I have completed a proctored exam worth 20% of my grade made up of multiple choice questions.
