#   Measurement System Analysis [<sup>[1]</sup>](#reference-1)				

## Brief Description

- In this course, I have learned to analyze measurement systems for process stability and statistical control and why having a stable measurement process is imperative prior to performing any statistical analysis. I analyzed continuous measurement systems and statistically characterize both accuracy and precision using R software. I performed measurement systems analysis for potential, short term and long term statistical control and capability.

## Prior knowledge needed:
