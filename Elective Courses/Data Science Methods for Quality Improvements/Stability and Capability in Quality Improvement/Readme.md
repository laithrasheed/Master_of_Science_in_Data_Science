#   Stability and Capability in Quality Improvement [<sup>[1]</sup>](#reference-1)				

## Brief Description

In this course, I have learned to analyze data in terms of process stability and statistical control and why having a stable process is imperative prior to performing statistical hypothesis testing. I have created statistical process control charts for both continuous and discrete data using R software. I analyzed data sets for statistical control using control rules based on probability. Additionally, I learned how to assess a process with respect to how capable it is of meeting specifications, either internal or external, and make decisions about process improvement.
