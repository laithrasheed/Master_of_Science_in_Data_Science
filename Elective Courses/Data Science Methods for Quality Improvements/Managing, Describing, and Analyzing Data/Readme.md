#   Managing, Describing, and Analyzing Data [<sup>[1]</sup>](#reference-1)				

## Brief Description

- In this course, you will learn the basics of understanding the data you have and why correctly classifying data is the first step to making correct decisions. You will describe data both graphically and numerically using descriptive statistics and R software. You will learn four probability distributions commonly used in the analysis of data. You will analyze data sets using the appropriate probability distribution. Finally, you will learn the basics of sampling error, sampling distributions, and errors in decision-making.
