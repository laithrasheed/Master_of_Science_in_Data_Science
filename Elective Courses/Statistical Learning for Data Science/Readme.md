# Statistical Learning for Data Science

**This specialization helped me to build upon my foundational knowledge of statistics and equiped me with advanced techniques for model selection, including regression, classification, trees, SVM, unsupervised learning, splines, and resampling methods. Additionally, I have gained an in-depth understanding of coefficient estimation and interpretation, which will be valuable in explaining and justifying my models to clients and companies. Through this specialization, I have acquired conceptual knowledge and communication skills to effectively convey the rationale behind my model choices and coefficient interpretations.**

**The specialization consists of three courses:**

### [(1) Regression and Classification](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/tree/main/Elective%20Courses/Statistical%20Learning%20for%20Data%20Science/Regression%20and%20Classification)

- I have completed a programming assignment worth 31% of my grade.


### [(2) Resampling, Selection, and Splines](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/tree/main/Elective%20Courses/Statistical%20Learning%20for%20Data%20Science/Resampling%2C%20Selection%2C%20and%20Splines)

I have completed a multiple choice exam worth 25% of my grade.


### [(3) Trees, SVM, and Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/laithrasheed/Master_of_Science_in_Data_Science/tree/main/Elective%20Courses/Statistical%20Learning%20for%20Data%20Science/Trees%2C%20SVM%2C%20and%20Unsupervised%20Learning)

- I have completed a programming assignment and multiple choice exam worth 25% of my grade.
