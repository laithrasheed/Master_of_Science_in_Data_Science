## Course Content

### Week 1    | Welcome 

The module provides an introductory overview of the course and introduces the course instructor.

#### Learning Objectives


#### Programming Assignment


### Week 2 |  Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

To begin the course, we will learn about support vector machines (SVMs). SVMs have become a popular method in the field of statistical learning due to their ability to handle non-linear and high-dimensional data. SVMs seek to maximize the margin, or distance between the decision boundary and the closest data points, to improve generalization performance. Throughout the week, you will learn how to apply SVMs to classify or predict outcomes in a given dataset, select appropriate kernel functions and parameters, and evaluate model performance 

#### Learning Objectives

- Describe SVMs and their applications.
- Describe the role of the kernel function in transforming the data into a higher dimensional space.
- Use R to estimate the SVM coefficients and interpret the results.

#### Programming Assignment

- Programming Assignments 

### Week 3   |  Introduction to Neural Networks

Neural Networks have become increasingly popular in the field of statistical learning due to their ability to model complex relationships in data. In this module, we will cover introductory concepts of neural networks, such as activation functions and backpropagation. You will have the opportunity to apply Neural Networks to classify or predict outcomes in a given dataset and evaluate model performance in the labs for this module.

#### Learning Objectives

- Describe the different types of activation functions and their characteristics.
- Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of neural networks compared to other machine learning algorithms, such as SVMs
- Define layers of neural networks, such as neurons, layers, and activation functions.

#### Programming Assignment

- Programming Assignments  

### Week 4 | Decision Trees

Welcome to the final module for the course. This module will focus on the ensemble methods decision trees, bagging, and random forests, which combine multiple models to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting. Decision Trees are a popular machine learning method that partitions the feature space into smaller regions and models the response variable in each region using simple rules. However, Decision Trees can suffer from high variance and instability, which can be addressed by Bagging and Random Forests. Bagging involves generating multiple trees on bootstrapped samples of the data and averaging their predictions, while Random Forests further decorrelate the trees by randomly selecting subsets of features for each tree.

#### Learning Objectives

- Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of decision trees compared to other machine learning algorithms, such as SVMs and neural networks.
- Build a decision tree model in R
- Interpret the output of a decision tree model, including the importance of each predictor and the resulting tree structure.
- Explain how decision trees work and how they make predictions.

#### Programming Assignment

### Week 5 |  Final Exam

You will complete a programming assignment and multiple choice exam worth 25% of your grade. You must attempt the final in order to earn a grade in the course. If you've upgraded to the for-credit version of this course, please make sure you review the additional for-credit materials in the Introductory module and anywhere else they may be found.
