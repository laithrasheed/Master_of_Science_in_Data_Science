#  Regression and Classification [<sup>[1]</sup>](#reference-1)				

## Brief Description

- Consists of the foundational framework & application of simple and multiple linear regression and classification methods.


## Prior knowledge needed: 
##### [Statistical Inference](https://github.com/laithrasheed/MSDS_Program_Private/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Foundations/Statistical%20Inference)


## Learning Outcomes

- Express why Statistical Learning is important and how it can be used.
- Identify the strengths, weaknesses and caveats of different models and choose the most appropriate model for a given statistical problem.
- Determine what type of data and problems require supervised vs. unsupervised techniques.

## Course Content

### Week 1   |  Introduction to Statistical Learning

Introduction to overarching and foundational concepts in Statistical Learning like Supervised vs Unsupervised, Prediction, Inference, Interpretability vs Flexibility, Parametric Methods, Quantitative vs. Qualitative, etc.

#### Learning Objectives

- Implement the idea of "no free lunch" in statistics, especially in the case of interpretability and flexibility.
- Understand the caveats and pros/cons of choosing models in different situations.
- Discuss and implement Classifications methods.

#### Programming Assignment

- Programming Assignments

### Week 2 |  | Accuracy

Exploration into assessing models in different situations. How do we define a "best" model for given data?

#### Learning Objectives

- Implement the idea of "no free lunch" in statistics, especially in the case of interpretability and flexibility.

#### Programming Assignment

- Programming Assignments 

### Week 3   |   Simple Linear Regression

Introduction to Simple Linear Regression, such as when and how to use it.

#### Learning Objectives

- Identify the strengths, weaknesses and caveats of different models and choose the most appropriate model for a given statistical problem.

#### Programming Assignment

- Programming Assignments  

### Week 4 |  Multiple Linear Regression

A deep dive into multiple linear regression, a strong and extremely popular technique for a continuous target.

#### Learning Objectives

- Choose the best model to solve a statistical problem based on the goal of the modeling.
- Identify the strengths, weaknesses and caveats of different models and choose the most appropriate model for a given statistical problem.

#### Programming Assignment

- Programming Assignments 

### Week 5 |   Classification Overview

Exploration of Linear Regression pitfalls and the strengths of Logistic Regression in certain situations. Foundational generative models will also be covered.

#### Learning Objectives

- Discuss and implement Classifications methods.
- Identify the strengths, weaknesses and caveats of different models and choose the most appropriate model for a given statistical problem.
- Choose the best model to solve a statistical problem based on the goal of the modeling.

#### Programming Assignment

- Programming Assignments   

### Week 6 | Classification Models

Investigation of popular classification techniques, such as LDA and QDA. We will also explore another Regression, Poisson Regression, as well as link functions, which connect all Regressions together.

#### Learning Objectives

- Discuss and implement Classifications methods.
- Choose the best model to solve a statistical problem based on the goal of the modeling.

#### Programming Assignment

- Programming Assignments   


### Week 7 |  Final Exam

You will complete a programming assignment worth 31% of your grade. You must attempt the final in order to earn a grade in the course. If you've upgraded to the for-credit version of this course, please make sure you review the additional for-credit materials in the Introductory module and anywhere else they may be found.
